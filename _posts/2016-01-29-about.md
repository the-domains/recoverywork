This blog is committed to scrutinising the welfare-to-work
approach adopted by the UK government, specifically in its impacts on people recovering from mental
health problems. Posts from other blogs, think-tanks, third sector and governmental organisations are shared and commented on, as well as original blog posts from time to time.

The author lives and works in the UK, within the mental health sector.
