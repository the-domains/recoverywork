<article style=""><h1>"If even the DWP isn't Disability Confident, how will a million disabled people get jobs?"</h1><p>Bernadette Meaden of Ekklesia reveals the hypocrisy that lies within the current welfare-to-work system. She cites the example of an employee with a disability at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), who was dismissed after taking extended sick leave. This is particularly disheartening, as the DWP made a big splash in 2013 with its 'Disability Confident' campaign, in which the government "committed to halving the employment gap between disabled people and non-disabled people" (DWP, 2014). Meaden debunks the absurdity of the government's implications that people receiving ESA (only an additional £30 a week) have no incentive to find work, though arguably if people are to be treated this way by their so called Disability Confident employers, I would not blame them for not wanting to go back to work.</p></article>
