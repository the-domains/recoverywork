            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Creating a future beyond the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) (now with easy read version)</h1><p>Following consultation with disability organisations, Ekklesia is conducting a survey of people with mental or physical health conditions in order to design a replacement for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) and the Work Capability Assessment (WCA).
